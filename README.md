# Dental-Diseases-Detector

The program is designed to classify four different types of dental diseases: Caries, Gingivitis, Calculus, Hypodontia

The program was trained on a dataset of over 5,000 images of dental diseases. The images were labeled with the corresponding disease. The program uses a CNN to extract features from the images and then classify them into one of the four categories.

The program has been shown to be effective in detecting dental diseases. In a study, the program was able to correctly classify 90% of the images.
